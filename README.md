# Traffic-Signs-Recognition-Project
A deep neural network that can recognize and identify traffic signs present in an image and classify them appropriately.
This project involves developing a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model,it's possible to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.
